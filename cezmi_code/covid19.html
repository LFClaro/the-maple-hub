                <p>Maple Leafs superstar Auston Matthews has tested positive for the coronavirus COVID-19, two National Hockey
                    League sources outside Toronto have confirmed to the Toronto Sun.<br>
    
                    Matthews, 22, has apparently gone into quarantine at his home in Arizona,
                    hoping to be healthy enough and eligible to travel to Toronto and participate in the opening of Leafs camp on July 10. <br>
    
                    Maple Leafs goaltender Frederik Andersen, who was spending much of the break from NHL play with Matthews’ at his Scottsdale home,
                    did not test positive for COVID-19, the same sources indicate.<br>
                    Andersen is no longer living with Matthews – and is no longer in Arizona.<br>
    
                    To date, the Maple Leafs have not commented on Matthews’ status and may have some kind of response later today or tomorrow.<br>
                    Apparently, the Leafs were seeking more “clarity” on the private matter before considering releasing a statement of any kind.<br>
    
                    Matthews was not available for comment Friday and his agent, Judd Moldaver, did not return messages left by the Sun.<br>
                    Andersen was not available for comment but a source close to the goaltender confirmed he had not tested positive.<br>
    
                    Matthews, who is in the first year of a five-year $58 million deal with the Leafs, is by no means alone in contracting the virus in Arizona, where cases have spiked in recent days.
                    According to sources, a numbers of unidentified Arizona Coyotes players, who were training alongside Matthews, also tested positive recently.
                    Players on other NHL teams have tested positive over the past few months.<br>
                    None have been identified publicly.<br>
    
                    The breaking news of the positive test of the 47-goal scorer on his way to 50 before the regular season was called off,
                    comes in the wake of the Tampa Bay Lightning closing its practice facilities and at about the same time the Philadelphia
                    Phillies have had an outbreak of COVID-19 in their Florida training facility.<br>
    
                    Matthews is alongside Ezekiel Elliott of the Dallas Cowboys as the highest profile professional athletes in
                    North America known to test positive for COVID-19. Former NBA star Patrick Ewing has tested positive, as well,
                    as has current NBA coach Mike Malone with the Denver Nuggets.<br>

                <p>The Toronto Maple Leafs released a statement Friday night saying they "will not be
                    commenting on reports surrounding testing for any of the club's players or staff."</p>
                <p>Here's the full statement:</p>
                <blockquote><q>Per the National Hockey League protocol with respect to COVID-19, the
                    Toronto Maple Leafs will not be commenting on reports surrounds testing for any of
                    the club's players or staff. A person's medical information in this regard is
                    private. The club will defer to the NHL's policy on handling the disclosure of
                    positive tests results, in that the league will provide updates on a regular
                    basis with aggregate totals of the numbers of tests conducted and number of
                    positive tests reported without disclosing either the identities of affected clubs or players.</q></blockquote>

                    — Kristen Shilton (@kristen_shilton) June 19, 2020 </p>
                <p>Earlier Friday, a report came down of a player on the Maple Leafs roster testing positive for COVID-19.</p>
    
                <p>Also on Friday, the Tampa Bay Lightning were forced to temporarily shut down their
                    training facility during Phase 2 because multiple players and some staff tested
                    positive for COVID-19, according to TSN Hockey Insider Bob McKenzie.
                    McKenzie believes it's three players and two staff members who tested positive and
                    adds that remaining players and staff are being tested. The expectation is the
                    training facility will re-open if there are no more positive tests.</p>
    
                <p>Last week, a Boston Bruins player became the 10th NHLer to have a confirmed case of the novel coronavirus.</p>
    
                <p>NHL training camps, otherwise known as Phase 3 of the league’s return-to-play plan, are expected to start on July 10.</p>
