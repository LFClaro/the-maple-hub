                        The Toronto Maple Leafs signed forward Joey Anderson to a three-year contract, 
                        the team announced Friday.
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        Anderson's deal is a two-way contract in the first two years 
                        and carries an annual cap hit of $750,000.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Toronto acquired Anderson in the trade that sent Andreas Johnsson to the 
                        New Jersey Devils earlier this offseason. New Jersey selected Anderson in the 
                        the third round of the 2016 draft and he's tallied 13 points in 52 career NHL games.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The 22-year-old has earned comparisons to Maple Leafs forward Zach Hyman.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "That's something I strive to be ... a guy that does things the right way, 
                        plays hard, he's in the right spots, doesn't take short cuts," Anderson told 
                        TSN's Mark Masters after the trade. "Definitely a player I would like to follow 
                        in the footsteps of."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Anderson may compete for a job with the Maple Leafs this upcoming season, 
                        but his two-way contract indicates he'll likely start the year with the 
                        AHL's Toronto Marlies.

                        Michael Hutchinson signed a two-year, two-way contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs on Friday. 
                        It has an average annual value of $725,000 at the NHL level.
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        The 30-year-old goalie was 5-9-1 with a 3.47 goals-against average, .888 save percentage and one shutout 
                        in 16 games (12 starts) with the Maple Leafs and Colorado Avalanche last season. 
                        He was 3-1-0 with a 1.98 GAA and a .943 save percentage in four games with 
                        Toronto of the American Hockey League.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Hutchinson is expected to be third on the Maple Leafs' depth chart behind goalies 
                        Frederik Andersen and Jack Campbell.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "I really loved my time with the Marlies," Hutchinson said of the Maple Leafs' AHL affiliate. 
                        "Every time I was down there was great, so that is a huge factor in signing here is, how much I enjoyed it. 
                        The coaching staff that's down there, the management, the equipment staff, 
                        the training staff, everyone really goes above and beyond and really treats you well 
                        and is amazing at their job.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "So for myself, you know, I'm excited to have a chance to be a part of the 
                        Marlies again and help that team win and just kind of do whatever the organization needs me to do."

                    <div class="text">
                        The Leafs found a home for another Marlie in Europe. 
                        This morning they announced that Mac Hollowell is off to Finland…
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        The Mestis is the second tier league in Finland below the Liiga, 
                        but given that top tier leagues are going to be difficult to place AHL 
                        players in, finding a team that has ice time for any prospect is a plus.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Hollowell had a solid first year of pro hockey, 
                        and I’d have to imagine the Leafs want to make sure he’s 
                        given every opportunity to build on that.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This move follows the Leafs decision to send Semyon 
                        Der-Arguchintsev to Torpedo of the KHL earlier this week, 
                        and now Hollowell, Der-Arguchintsev, Kral, Lehtonen, 
                        Korshkov and Hallander are all Leafs prospects playing 
                        overseas, in addition to that Joe Thornton guy who is 
                        kicking around Switzerland.
