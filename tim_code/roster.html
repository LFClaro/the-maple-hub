                Matthews is the NHL's Sun Belt growth come to spectacular life. 
                Who would have thought a decade or so ago that a player raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, would be the No. 1 pick in the 2016 NHL Draft -- 
                and a potential franchise player for the Toronto Maple Leafs after scoring 158 goals before his 23rd birthday? 
                <br>
                <br>
                Matthews was the first United States-born player to be chosen No. 1 since the Chicago Blackhawks took Patrick Kane with the first pick in the 2007 NHL Draft. 
                While growing up, he idolized players such as Shane Doan and Daniel Briere, members of the Phoenix/Arizona Coyotes, a franchise that relocated in 1996 from Winnipeg. 
                Matthews was an all-around athlete who chose to focus on hockey as an adolescent, and he excelled at every level of the game on his unique path to the NHL.</div>

                You would think the expectations that come with being a top draft pick of the Toronto Maple Leafs are tough enough 
                without comparisons to Hockey Hall of Famer Doug Gilmour being added to the mix.
                <br>
                <br>
                But Marner, who was selected by Toronto with the No. 4 pick in the 2015 NHL Draft, embraces being likened to Gilmour. 
                He even wore the former Maple Leafs center's No. 93 while playing for London of the Ontario Hockey League.

                The travel that goes along with a pro hockey career shouldn't be a problem for Nylander. 
                By age 20, he'd already been to a lot of NHL cities.

                He was born on May 1, 1996, in Calgary, when his father, longtime NHL forward Michael Nylander, a native of Sweden, was playing with the Flames. 
                William was raised in a series of cities in the U.S., as the family followed Michael's career to Tampa Bay, Chicago, Washington, Boston and New York. 
                In all, Michael played 920 games with seven NHL teams.

                Tavares launched a new chapter in his NHL career on July 1, 2018,

                Ontario, grew up rooting for.

                who selected him with the No. 1 pick in the 2009 NHL Draft. He had NHL career highs in goals (47) 
                and points (88) in his first season with the Maple Leafs and was named Toronto's captain on Oct. 2, 2019.

                Mikheyev was an instant hit in the NHL after signing with the Toronto Maple Leafs on May 6, 2019, 
                following four full seasons with Avangard Omsk of the Kontinental Hockey League, his hometown team.
            <br>
            <br>
            The 25-year-old forward made the Maple Leafs at training camp and made his NHL debut a memorable one by scoring one goal and assisting on another against the Ottawa Senators in Toronto's season-opener on Oct. 2, 2019. He became a regular and had scored his fourth goal in six games on Dec. 27, 2019, when a skate cut in a game severed an artery and tendons in his right wrist. He had surgery but was sidelined for the remainder of the season after scoring eight goals and 15 assists in 39 games.
